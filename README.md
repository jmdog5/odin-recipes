My first project while studying The Odin Project.

This is a recipe website to demonstrate the html I've learned so far.

I've created a homepage with a list of 3 different recipes, each linking to their own recipe page containing a picture, a description of the recipe, a list of ingredients, and a list of steps. I also took the opportunity to add a "Home" link at the top of each recipe page to return to the home page.
